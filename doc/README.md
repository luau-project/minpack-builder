# Documentation

Welcome to the minpack-builder wiki! Here, you can find all the possible configuration options supported by ```minpack-builder```, and detailed build-and-install instructions for minpack on different combinations of platform / Fortran compiler toolchain. Moreover, we provide documentation to use minpack as a CMake package after you installed it through ```minpack-builder```.

## Build and Install Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> At the moment, the documentation for usage is in early stages.

The build-and-install usage is split by platform and Fortran compiler. For now, you can check the usage on Linux, building minpack with GFortran.
